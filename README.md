# Teagan's Capstone Artist Setup for Blender

## Install and Configure WireGuard VPN

The Bender pipeline for Teagan's Capstone Project is being hosted on her parent's home network.  In order to access that network, you need to install and run the WireGuard VPN client on your computer.

1. Download the appropriate installer from: <https://www.wireguard.com/install/>.

   **_NOTE:_**  Make note of where you downloaded the file so that you can run it and then delete it when finished.

1. Run the installer you just downloaded and follow all the installation prompts.

**_NOTE:_**  You do not need to keep the VPN running when you are not accessing the pipeline.  However, since the VPN is only used for accessing the pipeline servers, you really shouldn't even know it is there.  One downside to stopping the VPN is that the Flamenco Rendering Farm will not be able to use your computer as a part of the farm while you are disconnected.
